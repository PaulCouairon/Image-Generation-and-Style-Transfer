# Image-Generation-and-Style-Transfer

The objective of this project is twofold. First we study and implement a GAN architecture from Goodfellow's research paper: _Generative Adversarial Network_. 
Then we implement a neural style transfer algorithm. 

Project done as part of the Introduction to Deep Learning with Python course, taught in the M2 Data Science at IP Paris.
